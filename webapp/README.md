A TypeScript-based npm package and web application to run test cases for distributed WebSocket servers. This tool helps in load testing, connection stability checks, and real-time message validation across multiple WebSocket instances.

## Overview

### Project Description and Purpose
EvenWsTest is designed to facilitate the testing of distributed WebSocket servers. It allows users to simulate multiple WebSocket clients, send and receive messages in real-time, and validate server responses. The project includes both a backend npm package and a frontend web application for managing and running test configurations.

### Key Features and Functionality
- Simulate multiple WebSocket clients.
- Send and receive messages in real-time.
- Validate server responses.
- Support for distributed WebSocket environments.
- Customizable test scripts.
- Detailed logs and metrics.
- Web interface for creating and managing test configurations.
